=========================================================================

Shapefile makes ESRI shapefiles available in Javascript. Currently all 
shape types other than MultiPatch have been implemented. MultiPatch is a 
complex shape that will require some thought. Further only Polygon has
been tested as I only have Polygon shapefiles at the moment and have not
taken the time to mock up sample data, although I am fairly confident
the code matches the documentation precisely.

Shapefile is designed to be rendering method agnostic and accomplishes
this by exposing the vertices as lat/lon points that may then be
transformed to the desired projection.

A live two dimensional orthographic projection example can be found at
http://tlahoda.org/render2d.html A three dimensional WebGL example can be
found at http://tlahoda.org . Be forewarned this demo may take a long time
to load (as in a miute or so) on some browsers (namely firefox). It is
best viewed in Google Chrome.
