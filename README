=========================================================================

Shapefile makes ESRI shapefiles available in Javascript. Currently all 
shape types other than MultiPatch have been implemented. MultiPatch is a 
complex shape that will require some thought. Further only Polygon has
been tested as I only have Polygon shapefiles at the moment and have not
taken the time to mock up sample data.

Shapefile is designed to be rendering method agnostic as it exposes the
vertices as lat/lon points that may then be transformed to the desired
projection.

The examples directory contains examples of two dimensional and three
dimensional rendering. Lives examples can be found at
http://tlahoda.org/render2d.html for a two dimensional representation of
a shapefile.

A three dimensional WebGL example is located at http://tlahoda.org . Be
forewarned this demo may take a long time to load (as in a miute or so)
on some browsers (namely firefox). It is best viewed in Google Chrome.
